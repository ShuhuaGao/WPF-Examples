# A demo to learn AvalonDock (accompanied by Stylet)

## Tutorials
Mainly follow the tutorials listed at https://github.com/Dirkster99/AvalonDock, but try to simplify it with the dedicated MVVM framework *Stylet*.

## Required NuGet Packages
- Dirkster.AvalonDock
- Stylet
- Template [Stylet.Templates.VM](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Stylet.Templates.VM/) to generate a Stylet project quickly by 
    ```
    dotnet new stylet.vm -n EdiAvalon
    ```
